Minos Garofalakis</a></i>
is the Director of the Information Management Systems Institute (IMSI)
at the "Athena" Research and Innovation Centre in Athens, Greece, a Professor of Computer
Science at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Technical University of 
Crete (TUC) (where he directs
the Software Technology and Network Applications Laboratory (SoftNet)), and a research consultant (part-time)
at Huawei's Edinburgh Research Centre (ERC). 
He received the Diploma degree in 
Computer Engineering and Informatics (School of Engineering Valedictorian) from the University 
of Patras, Greece in 1992, and the MSc and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison in 1994 and 1998, respectively. He worked as a Member of Technical 
Staff at Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, NJ (1998-2005), as a Senior Researcher 
at Intel Research Berkeley in Berkeley, CA (2005-2007), as a Principal Research Scientist
at Yahoo! Research in Santa Clara, CA (2007-2008), and as a research consultant for 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) (2022-2023). During 2006-2008, he also held an Adjunct Associate
Professor position at the EECS Department of the University of California, Berkeley. 
He served as the TUC ECE Department Chair for the period 9/2011-9/2013 and,
between 11/2012-3/2015, he was a Member of the Board of Directors of Information Society, S.A., a 
Greek government organization for advancing large-scale, national-level efforts in Information and Communication Technologies.

Prof. Garofalakis 
was the Core Database Technology PC Chair for VLDB'2007,  the Knowledge Management Track
PC Chair for ACM CIKM'2014, and the General Co-Chair for IEEE ICDE'2021, and has 
completed Associate Editor/Editorial Board Member terms for various journals in the data management
field, including ACM Transactions on Database Systems (ACM TODS, 2008-2011), 
IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (IEEE TKDE, 2007-2011), and
Foundations and Trends in Databases (FnTDB, 2006-2019).
He has also repeatedly 
served on the program committees of all major data-management conferences (including ACM SIGMOD, 
VLDB, ACM PODS, IEEE ICDE, and ACM SIGKDD), often in PC Group Leader/Area Vice-Chair roles.

Prof. Garofalakis' research interests are in the broad areas of Big Data analytics and large-scale
machine learning, including database systems, centralized/distributed 
data streams, data synopses and approximate query processing, uncertain databases, and 
data mining and knowledge discovery.
He has published over 150 scientific papers in top-tier international conferences and 
journals in these areas.  He received the 2009 IEEE ICDE Best 
Paper Award for his paper "Histograms and Wavelets on Probabilistic Data" (with G. Cormode, AT&T-Labs), 
and 8 of his SIGMOD/PODS/VLDB papers have been invited to journal special issues (ranking in the 
top 3-5 papers of their respective conferences). He has delivered several invited keynote talks and 
conference tutorials on approximate query processing, data-stream processing, and distributed data streams, 
and has given invited tutorials on data streaming at the 2008 VLDB School in Cairo, Egypt, 
the 2015 INIT/AERFAI Summer School on Machine Learning,
the 2015 and 2017 International Winter School on Big Data, and 
the 1st ACM Europe Summer School on Data Science and Big Data.
His work has resulted in 36 US Patent filings (29 patents issued) for companies such as 
Lucent, Yahoo!, and AT&T.
