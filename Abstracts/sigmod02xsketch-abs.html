<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Effective support for XML query languages is becoming increasingly important
with the emergence of new applications that access large volumes of XML data.
All existing proposals for querying XML (e.g., XQuery) rely on a 
pattern-specification language  that allows path navigation and branching
through the XML data graph in order to reach the desired data elements.  Optimizing such
queries depends crucially on the existence of concise synopsis structures that enable
accurate compile-time selectivity estimates for complex path expressions over
graph-structured XML data.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to building and using statistical 
summaries of large XML data graphs for effective path-expression selectivity
estimation.  Our proposed graph-synopsis model (termed XSketch) exploits 
localized graph stability
to accurately approximate (in limited space) the path and branching distribution
in the data graph. To estimate
the selectivities of complex path expressions over concise XSketch synopses, 
we develop an estimation framework that relies on appropriate statistical 
(uniformity and independence) assumptions to compensate for the lack of detailed
distribution information.  Given our estimation framework, we demonstrate that
the problem of building an accuracy-optimal XSketch  for a given amount of space 
is NP-hard, and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm based on greedy forward
selection. Briefly, our algorithm constructs an XSketch synopsis by successive 
refinements of the label-split graph, the coarsest summary of the XML data graph.  
Our refinement operations act locally and attempt to capture important statistical 
correlations between data paths. 
Extensive experimental results with  synthetic as well as real-life data sets verify 
the effectiveness of our approach.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to address this timely
problem in the most general setting of graph-structured data and complex
(branching) path expressions.
