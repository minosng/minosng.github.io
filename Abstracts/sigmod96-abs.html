<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Scheduling query execution plans is an important component of query optimization
in parallel database systems.  The problem is particularly complex in a  shared-
nothing execution environment, where each system node represents a collection of
time-shareable resources (e.g.,  CPU(s), disk(s), etc.)  and  communicates  with
other  nodes  only  by   message-passing.    Significant   research  effort  has
concentrated on only a  subset of the various forms of  intra-query  parallelism
so that scheduling and synchronization is simplified. In addition, most previous
work has focused its attention  on  one-dimensional  models  of  parallel  query
scheduling, effectively ignoring the potential benefits of resource sharing.
<BR>
In this paper, we develop an approach that is more general  in  both directions,
capturing all forms of intra-query  parallelism and exploiting sharing of multi-
dimensional  resource  nodes  among  concurrent  plan  operators.   This  allows
scheduling a set of independent query tasks  (i.e.,  operator pipelines)  to  be
seen as an instance of the multi-dimensional bin-design problem.   Using a novel
quantification of  coarse  grain  parallelism,   we present  a  list  scheduling
heuristic algorithm that is  provably  near-optimal in the class of coarse grain
parallel executions (with a  worst-case  performance  ratio that depends on  the
number of resources per node and the granularity parameter). We then extend this
algorithm to handle the operator precedence constraints in a bushy query plan by
splitting  the  execution  of  the plan into  synchronized  phases.  Preliminary
performance  results  confirm  the  effectiveness  of our  scheduling  algorithm
compared both to previous approaches and  the  optimal  solution.   Finally,  we
present a technique that allows us to relax the  coarse granularity  restriction
and obtain a list scheduling method that is  provably near-optimal  in the space
of all possible parallel schedules.
