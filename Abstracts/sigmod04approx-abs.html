<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
The rapid adoption of XML as the standard for data representation and
exchange foreshadows a massive increase in the amounts of XML data
collected, maintained, and queried over the Internet or in large
corporate data-stores. Inevitably, this will result in the development
of on-line decision support systems, where users and analysts 
interactively explore large XML data sets through a declarative query
interface (e.g., XQuery or XSLT). Given the importance of remaining
interactive, such on-line systems can employ approximate query answers
as an effective mechanism for reducing response time and providing 
users with early feedback. This approach has been successfully used 
in relational systems and it becomes even more compelling in the 
XML world, where the evaluation of complex queries over massive 
tree-structured data is inherently more expensive. 

In this paper, we initiate a study of approximate query answering
techniques for large XML databases. Our approach is based on a novel,
conceptually simple, yet very effective XML-summarization mechanism:
TreeSketch synopses.  We demonstrate that,
unlike earlier techniques focusing solely on selectivity estimation,
our TreeSketch synopses are much more effective in capturing the complete 
tree structure of the underlying XML database.  We propose novel
construction algorithms for building TreeSketch summaries of limited size,
and describe schemes for processing   
general XML twig queries over a concise TreeSketch in order to produce very
fast, approximate <i>tree-structured query answers</i>.  To quantify
the quality of such approximate answers, we propose a novel, intuitive
error metric that captures the quality of the approximation in terms
of both the overall structure of the XML tree and the distribution 
of document edges. Experimental results on real-life and synthetic
data sets verify the effectiveness of our TreeSketch synopses in producing
fast, accurate approximate answers and demonstrate their benefits
over previously proposed techniques that focus solely on selectivity
estimation. In particular, TreeSketches yield faster, more accurate
approximate answers and selectivity estimates, and are more efficient
to construct.  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work
to address the timely problem of producing fast, approximate 
tree-structured answers for complex XML queries.
