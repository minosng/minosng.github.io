<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
The prevalent use of XML highlights the need for a generic,
flexible access-control mechanism for XML documents that supports
efficient and secure query access, without revealing sensitive
information to unauthorized users. This paper introduces
a novel paradigm for specifying XML security constraints and
investigates the enforcement of such constraints during XML
query evaluation. Our approach is based on the novel concept of
<i>security views</i>, which provide for each user group
(a) an XML view consisting of all and only the information
that the users are authorized to access, and
(b) a view DTD that the XML view conforms to.
Security views effectively protect sensitive data from access
and potential inferences by unauthorized users, and provide
authorized users with necessary schema information to facilitate
effective query formulation and optimization.
We propose an efficient algorithm for deriving security view
definitions from
security policies (defined on the original document DTD) for different
user groups.
We also develop novel algorithms for XPath query rewriting and optimization
such that queries over security views can be efficiently answered
without materializing the views.
Our algorithms transform a query over a security view to an
equivalent query over the original document, and effectively prune query
nodes by exploiting the structural properties of the document DTD in
conjunction with approximate XPath containment tests.
Our work is the first to study
a flexible, DTD-based access-control model for XML and its implications
on the XML query-execution engine.  Furthermore, it is among the first
efforts for query rewriting and optimization in the presence of
general DTDs for a rich class of XPath queries.
An empirical study based on real-life
DTDs  verifies the effectiveness of our approach.
