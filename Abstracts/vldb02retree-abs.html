<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Due  to their expressive power, 
Regular Expressions (REs) are quickly becoming an integral part of 
language specifications for several important application scenarios.
Many of these applications have to manage huge databases of RE specifications
and need to provide an effective matching mechanism that, given an input string, 
quickly identifies the REs in the database that match it.
In this paper, we propose the RE-tree, a novel index structure for large
databases of RE specifications. 
Given an input query string, the RE-tree speeds up the retrieval of matching 
REs by focusing the search and comparing the input string with only a small 
fraction of REs in the database.
Even though the RE-tree is similar in spirit to other tree-based structures that
have been proposed for indexing multi-dimensional data, RE indexing
is significantly more challenging since  REs typically represent infinite
sets of strings with no well-defined notion of spatial locality.
To address these new challenges, our RE-tree index structure relies on novel 
measures for comparing the relative sizes of infinite regular languages.
We also propose innovative solutions for the various RE-tree operations,
including the effective splitting of RE-tree nodes and computing a "tight"
bounding RE for a collection of REs.
Finally, we demonstrate how sampling-based approximation algorithms can be used to 
significantly speed up the performance of RE-tree operations.
Our experimental results with synthetic data sets indicate that the RE-tree is very
effective in pruning the search space and easily outperforms naive 
sequential search approaches.
