<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
There is growing interest in algorithms for processing and
querying continuous data streams (i.e., data that is seen
only once in a fixed order) with limited memory resources.
In its most general form, a data stream is actually an <i>update</i>
stream, i.e., comprising data-item deletions as well as insertions.
Such massive update streams arise naturally in several application
domains (e.g., monitoring of large IP network installations, or
processing of retail-chain transactions).

Estimating the cardinality of set expressions defined over several
(perhaps, distributed) update streams is perhaps one of the most
fundamental query classes of interest; as an example, such a query may ask
"what is the number of distinct IP source addresses seen in passing
packets from both router R1 and R2 but not router R3?".
Earlier work has only addressed very restricted forms of this problem,
focusing solely on the special case of <i>insert-only</i> streams and
specific operators (e.g., union).  In this paper, we propose the <i>first</i>
space-efficient algorithmic solution for estimating the cardinality of
full-fledged set expressions over general update streams. Our estimation
algorithms are probabilistic in nature and rely on a novel, hash-based
synopsis data structure, termed <i>"2-level hash sketch"</i>.
We demonstrate how our 2-level hash sketch synopses can be used to 
provide low-error, high-confidence
estimates for the cardinality of set expressions (including operators
such as set union, intersection, and difference) over continuous update
streams, using only small space and small processing time per update.
Furthermore, our estimators never require rescanning or resampling
of past stream items, regardless of the number of deletions in the stream.
We also present lower bounds for the problem, demonstrating that the space
usage of our estimation algorithms is within small factors of the optimal.
Preliminary experimental results verify the effectiveness of our approach.
