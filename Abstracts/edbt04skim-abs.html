<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
There is a growing interest in on-line algorithms
for analyzing and querying data streams, that examine each stream element
only once and have at their disposal, only a limited amount of memory.
Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to aggregate queries over such
streams is a crucial requirement for many application environments;
examples include large IP network installations where performance
data from different parts of the network needs to be continuously
collected and analyzed.
In this paper, we present the <i>skimmed-sketch</i> algorithm for
estimating the join size of two streams.
(Our techniques also readily extend to other join-aggregate
queries.)
To the best of our knowledge, our
skimmed-sketch technique is the first comprehensive join-size estimation
algorithm to provide tight error guarantees while:
(1) achieving the lower bound on the space required by any join-size
estimation method in a streaming environment,
(2) handling streams containing general update operations (inserts and deletes),
(3) incurring a low logarithmic processing
time per stream element, and
(4) not assuming any a-priori knowledge of the frequency distribution for
domain values.
Our skimmed-sketch technique achieves all of the above by first skimming
the dense frequencies from random hash-sketch summaries of the two streams.
It then computes the subjoin
size involving only dense frequencies directly, and uses the skimmed sketches
only to approximate subjoin sizes for the non-dense frequencies.
Results  from
our experimental study with real-life as well as synthetic data streams
indicate that our skimmed-sketch algorithm provides significantly more
accurate estimates for join sizes compared to earlier
sketch-based techniques.
