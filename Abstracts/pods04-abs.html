<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the
wavelet decomposition as a tool for reducing large amounts of data
down to compact <i>wavelet synopses</i> that can be used to obtain
fast, accurate approximate answers to user queries.
While conventional wavelet synopses are based on greedily minimizing 
the overall root-mean-squared (i.e., <em>L</em><sub>2</sub>-norm) 
error in the data approximation, recent work has demonstrated that
such synopses can suffer from important problems, including  severe 
bias and wide variance in the quality of the data reconstruction,
and lack of non-trivial guarantees for individual
approximate answers.
As a result, <i>probabilistic thresholding schemes</i> have been
recently proposed as a means of building wavelet synopses that try
to <i>probabilistically</i> control other approximation-error metrics,
such as the maximum relative error in data-value reconstruction,
which is arguably the most important for approximate query answers
and meaningful error guarantees.

One of the main open problems posed by this earlier work is whether
it is possible to design efficient  <i>deterministic</i> wavelet-thresholding
algorithms for minimizing non-<em>L</em><sub>2</sub> error 
metrics that are relevant to approximate query processing systems,
such as maximum relative or maximum absolute error.
Obviously, such algorithms can guarantee better wavelet synopses
and avoid the pitfalls of probabilistic techniques (e.g., "bad"
coin-flip sequences) leading to poor solutions.
In this paper, we address this problem and propose novel, 
computationally efficient schemes for deterministic wavelet 
thresholding  with the objective of optimizing maximum-error 
metrics.
We introduce an <i>optimal</i> low polynomial-time
algorithm for <i>one-dimensional</i> wavelet thresholding -- 
our algorithm is based on a new Dynamic-Programming  (DP)
formulation, and can be employed to minimize the maximum 
relative or  absolute error in the data reconstruction.
Unfortunately, directly extending our one-dimensional DP algorithm to 
<i>multi-dimensional</i> wavelets results in a super-exponential
increase in time complexity with the data dimensionality.
Thus, we also introduce novel, polynomial-time <i>approximation schemes</i>
(with tunable approximation guarantees for the target maximum-error metric)
for deterministic wavelet thresholding in multiple dimensions.
