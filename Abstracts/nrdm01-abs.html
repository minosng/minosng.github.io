<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
While a variety of lossy compression schemes have been developed
for certain forms of digital data (e.g., images, audio, video), 
the area of lossy compression techniques for arbitrary data tables
has been left relatively unexplored. Nevertheless, such techniques 
are clearly motivated  by the ever-increasing data collection rates
of modern enterprises and the need for effective, guaranteed-quality
approximate answers to queries over massive relational data sets.
In this paper, we propose  Model-Based Semantic Compression (MBSC),
a novel data-compression framework that takes advantage of attribute
semantics and data-mining models to perform lossy compression of 
massive data tables. 
We describe the architecture and some of the key algorithms 
underlying SPARTAN,  a model-based semantic compression system 
that exploits predictive data correlations and  prescribed
error tolerances for individual attributes to construct concise 
and accurate  Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT) models 
for entire columns of a table.
More precisely, SPARTAN selects a certain subset of attributes
for which no values are explicitly stored in the compressed table;
instead, concise CaRTs  that predict these values (within the
prescribed error bounds) are maintained.
To restrict the huge search space and construction cost of possible
CaRT predictors, SPARTAN employs sophisticated learning techniques 
and novel combinatorial optimization algorithms.
Our experimentation with several real-life data sets has offered convincing
evidence of the effectiveness of SPARTAN's model-based approach --  
SPARTAN  is able to consistently yield substantially better
compression ratios than existing semantic or syntactic compression tools
(e.g., gzip) while utilizing only small data samples for model inference.
Several promising directions for future research and possible applications
of MBSC in the context of network management are identified and discussed.
