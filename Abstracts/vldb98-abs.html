<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Scheduling algorithms for composite multimedia presentations need to
ensure that the user-defined synchronization constraints for the
various presentation components are met.
This requirement gives rise to task models that are significantly more 
complex than the models employed in scheduling theory and practice.
In this paper, we formulate  the resource scheduling problems for composite
multimedia objects and develop novel efficient scheduling algorithms drawing 
on a number  of techniques from pattern matching and multiprocessor scheduling.
Our formulation is based on a novel  sequence packing problem, where the 
goal is  to superimpose numeric sequences (representing the objects' resource needs
as a function of time) within a fixed capacity bin (representing the server's 
resource capacity).
Given the intractability of the problem, we propose heuristic  solutions using
a two-step approach.
First, we present a "basic step" method for packing two composite object sequences 
into a single, combined sequence.
Second, we show how this basic step can be employed within different scheduling 
algorithms to obtain a playout schedule for multiple objects.
More specifically, we present an algorithm based on Graham's list-scheduling 
method that is provably near-optimal for  monotonic  object sequences.
We also suggest a number of optimizations on the base list-scheduling
scheme.
Preliminary experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.
