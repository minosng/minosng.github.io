<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
All existing proposals for querying XML (e.g., XQuery) rely on a
pattern-specification language  that allows
(1) <i>path navigation and branching through the label structure</i> of the XML
    data graph, and
(2) <i>predicates on the values</i> of specific path/branch nodes, in order to
reach the desired data elements.
Optimizing such queries depends crucially on the existence of concise synopsis
structures that enable accurate compile-time selectivity estimates for
complex path expressions over graph-structured XML data.
In this paper, we extend our earlier work on structural XSketch 
synopses and we propose an (augmented) XSketch synopsis model that exploits
localized stability and value-distribution summaries (e.g.,
histograms) to accurately capture the
complex correlation patterns that can exist between and across path structure
and element values in the data graph.
We develop a systematic XSketch estimation framework for complex path
expressions with value predicates
and we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm based on
greedy forward selection for building an effective XSketch for a given
amount of space (which is, in general, an NP-hard optimization problem).
Implementation results with both synthetic and real-life data sets verify the
effectiveness of our approach.
