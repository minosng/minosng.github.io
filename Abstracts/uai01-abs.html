<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for performing stepwise selection
in the class of decomposable models. We focus on the  forward selection
procedure, but we also discuss how  backward selection and the combination 
of the two can be performed efficiently. The main contributions of this paper
are (1) a simple characterization for the edges that can be added to a 
decomposable model while retaining its decomposability and (2) an efficient 
algorithm for enumerating all such edges for a given decomposable model in 
O(n^2) time, where n is the number of variables in the model. 

We also analyze the complexity of the overall stepwise selection procedure
(which includes the complexity of enumerating eligible edges as well as
the complexity of deciding how to "progress"). 
We use the KL divergence of the model from  the saturated model as our 
metric, but the results we present here extend to many other
metrics as well.
