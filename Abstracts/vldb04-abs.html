<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
We consider the problem of estimating set-expression cardinality
in a <i>distributed streaming</i> environment
where rapid update streams originating at remote sites are
continually transmitted to a central processing system.
At the core of our
algorithmic solutions for answering set-expression
cardinality queries
are two novel techniques for lowering data communication
costs without sacrificing answer precision. Our first technique
exploits global knowledge of the distribution of certain
frequently occurring stream elements to significantly reduce the
transmission of element state information to the central site.
Our second technical contribution involves a novel way of capturing the
semantics of the input set expression in a boolean logic formula,
and using models (of the formula) to determine whether
an element state change at a remote site can affect the set expression
result.
Results of our experimental study with real-life as
well as synthetic data sets indicate that our distributed
set-expression cardinality estimation algorithms achieve
substantial reductions in message traffic compared to naive approaches
that provide the same accuracy guarantees.
