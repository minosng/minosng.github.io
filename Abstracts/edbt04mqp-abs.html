<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in designing
algorithms for querying and analyzing streaming data (i.e., data
that is seen only once in a fixed order) with only limited memory.
Providing (perhaps approximate) answers to queries over such
continuous data streams is a crucial requirement for many
application environments; examples include large telecom and
IP network installations where performance data from different
parts of the network needs to be continuously collected and
analyzed.

Randomized techniques, based on computing small "sketch" synopses
for each stream, have recently been shown to be a very effective tool
for approximating the result of a single SQL query over streaming data
tuples. In this paper, we investigate the problems arising when
data-stream sketches are used to process <i>multiple</i> such queries
concurrently. We demonstrate that, in the presence of multiple query
expressions, intelligently <i>sharing sketches</i> among concurrent
query evaluations can result in substantial improvements in the
utilization of the available sketching space and the quality of the
resulting approximation error guarantees.
We provide necessary and sufficient conditions
for multi-query sketch sharing that guarantee the correctness of the
result-estimation process.
We also prove that optimal sketch sharing typically gives rise to
NP-hard questions, and we propose novel heuristic algorithms for
finding good sketch-sharing configurations in practice.
Results from our experimental study with realistic workloads verify
the effectiveness of our approach, clearly demonstrating the benefits
of our sketch-sharing methodology.
