<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
The enhanced pay-per-view (EPPV) model for providing
continuous-media-on-demand (CMOD) services associates with each continuous 
media clip a display frequency that depends on the clip's popularity. 
The aim is to
increase the number of clients that can be serviced concurrently 
beyond the capacity limitations of available resources,
while guaranteeing a constraint on the response time. 
This is achieved by sharing periodic continuous media
streams among multiple clients. 
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study
of the resource scheduling problems associated with supporting EPPV for
continuous media clips with (possibly) different display rates, frequencies,
and lengths. 
Our main objective is to maximize the amount of disk bandwidth that 
is effectively scheduled under the given data layout and 
storage constraints. 
This formulation gives rise to NP-hard combinatorial 
optimization problems that fall within the realm of
hard real-time scheduling theory. 
Given the intractability of the problems,
we propose  novel heuristic solutions with polynomial-time complexity.
Preliminary results from an experimental evaluation of the 
proposed schemes are also presented.
