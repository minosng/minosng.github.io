<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Scheduling query execution plans is a particularly complex problem in
hierarchical parallel systems, where each site consists of a collection
of local time-shared (e.g., CPU(s) or disk(s)) and space-shared (e.g.,
memory) resources and communicates with remote sites by message-passing.
We develop a general approach to the problem,
capturing the full complexity of scheduling distributed multi-dimensional
resource units for all kinds of parallelism within and across queries and
operators.  We present heuristic algorithms for various forms of the
problem, some of which are provably near-optimal.
Preliminary experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.
