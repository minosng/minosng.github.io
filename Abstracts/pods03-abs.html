<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
We propose the first known solution to the problem of
correlating, in small space, continuous streams of XML data through
approximate (structure and content) matching, as defined by a general
tree-edit distance metric.
The key element of our solution is a novel algorithm for obliviously
embedding tree-edit distance metrics into an <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> 
vector space while guaranteeing an upper bound of 
<em>O(log<sup>2</sup>n log<sup>*</sup>n)</em>
on the distance distortion between any data trees 
with at most <em>n</em> nodes.
We demonstrate how our embedding algorithm can be applied in conjunction
with known random sketching techniques to: (1) build a compact synopsis
of a massive, streaming XML data tree that can be used as a concise
surrogate for the full tree in approximate tree-edit distance
computations; and, (2) approximate
the result of tree-edit-distance similarity joins over continuous XML
document streams.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithmic results
on low-distortion embeddings for tree-edit distance metrics, and on
correlating (e.g., through similarity joins) XML data in the streaming
model.
