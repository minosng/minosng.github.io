<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Twig queries represent the building blocks of declarative query languages
over XML data. A twig query describes a complex traversal of the document
graph and generates a set of element tuples based on the intertwined
evaluation (i.e., join) of multiple path expressions. Estimating the result
cardinality of twig queries or, equivalently, the number of tuples in such
a structural (path-based) join, is a fundamental problem that arises in the
optimization of declarative queries over XML. It is crucial, therefore,
to develop concise synopsis structures that summarize the document
graph and enable such selectivity estimates within the time and space
constraints of the optimizer. In this paper, we propose novel
summarization and estimation techniques for estimating the selectivity
of twig queries with complex XPath expressions over tree-structured data.
Our approach is based on the XSketch model, augmented with new types of
distribution information for capturing complex correlation patterns across
structural joins. Briefly, the key idea is to represent joins as points in a
multidimensional space of path counts that capture aggregate
information on the contents of the resulting element tuples. We
develop a systematic framework that combines distribution information
with appropriate statistical assumptions in order to provide
selectivity estimates for twig queries over
concise XSketch synopses and we describe an efficient algorithm for
constructing an accurate summary for a given space budget. Implementation results
with both synthetic and real-life data sets verify the effectiveness of our
approach and demonstrate its benefits over earlier techniques.
