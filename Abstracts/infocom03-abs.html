<b><h4>Abstract</h4></b>
Knowledge of the up-to-date physical (i.e., layer-2) topology of an Ethernet
network is crucial to a number of critical network management tasks, including
reactive and proactive resource management, event correlation, and root-cause
analysis.  Given the dynamic nature of today's IP networks, keeping track of topology
information manually is a daunting (if not impossible) task.  Thus,
effective algorithms for automatically discovering physical network
topology are necessary.
In this paper,  we propose the <i>first</i> complete algorithmic solution
for discovering the physical topology of a large, heterogeneous Ethernet
network comprising multiple subnets as well as (possibly) dumb or uncooperative
network elements.
Our algorithms rely on standard SNMP MIB information that is widely supported
in modern IP networks and require no modifications to the operating
system software running on elements or hosts.
Furthermore, we formally demonstrate that our solution is <i>complete</i>  for
the given MIB data; that is, if the MIB information is sufficient to uniquely
identify the network topology then our algorithm is guaranteed to recover it.
To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first solution to provide such a
strong completeness guarantee.
